# Exercise 3 (10P)

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Create an interactive python script (use the file second_steps.py) that asks the user to enter her/his full name.
3. Print the length of the first and last name.
4. For each unique letter that occurs in the string, count the number of it's occurrences (ignoring upper/lower case) and save the letters/values to two lists (e.g.: Benjamin Rösner would result in the lists [b,e,n,j,a,m,i,r,ö,s] and [1,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,1,1])
5. Print both lists
6. Commit your work and push it to github.
