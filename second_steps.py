# Satellites:
sat_database = {"METEOSAT" : 3000,
                "LANDSAT"  : 30,
                "MODIS"    : 500
               }

# The dictionary above contains the names and spatial resolutions of some satellite systems.

# 1) Add the "GOES" and "worldview" satellites with their 2000/0.31m resolution to the dictionary [2P]

print("I have the following satellites in my database:")

# 2) print out all satellite names contained in the dictionary [2P]

# 3) Ask the user to enter the satellite name from which she/he would you like to know the resolution [2P]

# 4) Check, if the satellite is in the database and inform the user, if it is not [2P]

# 5) If the satellite name is in the database, print a meaningful message containing the satellite name and it's resolution [2P]
