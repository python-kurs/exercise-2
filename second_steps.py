# Exercise 2

# List of satellites
satellites = ["MODIS","METEOSAT","LANDSAT","GOES"]

# The corresponding spatial resolutions in metres
resolutions = [500,3000,30,2000]

# 1) Add the worldview satellite with its 0.31m resolution to the lists above [1P]

# 2) Print "The satellite <satellite-name> has a spatial resolution of <resolution>" for each satellite with a resolution above 600m [4P]

# Use loops and conditional cases for these tasks. Try to avoid direct index calls and redundancy.
